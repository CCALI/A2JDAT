For example, it does not implement any part of the DOM that would require the use of accessors; it's just an attempt to faithfully represent the DOM as a data structure, not its complete API surface. (If you need the whole enchilada, check out something like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), which is much more complete.)\n\n```sh\nnpm install simple-dom\n```\n\n",
